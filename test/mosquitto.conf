# -----------------------------------------------------------------
# External authentication and topic access plugin options
# -----------------------------------------------------------------

# External authentication and access control can be supported with the
# auth_plugin option. This is a path to a loadable plugin. See also the
# auth_opt_* options described below.
#
# The auth_plugin option can be specified multiple times to load multiple
# plugins. The plugins will be processed in the order that they are specified
# here. If the auth_plugin option is specified alongside either of
# password_file or acl_file then the plugin checks will be made first.
#
#auth_plugin

# If the auth_plugin option above is used, define options to pass to the
# plugin here as described by the plugin instructions. All options named
# using the format auth_opt_* will be passed to the plugin, for example:
#
# auth_opt_db_host
# auth_opt_db_port
# auth_opt_db_username
# auth_opt_db_password

# -----------------------------------------------------------------
# Default authentication and topic access control
# -----------------------------------------------------------------

# Control access to the broker using a password file. This file can be
# generated using the mosquitto_passwd utility. If TLS support is not compiled
# into mosquitto (it is recommended that TLS support should be included) then
# plain text passwords are used, in which case the file should be a text file
# with lines in the format:
# username:password
# The password (and colon) may be omitted if desired, although this
# offers very little in the way of security.
#
# See the TLS client require_certificate and use_identity_as_username options
# for alternative authentication options. If an auth_plugin is used as well as
# password_file, the auth_plugin check will be made first.
#password_file
